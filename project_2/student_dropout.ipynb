    "This notebook, inspired by [Martins et al.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-72657-7_16), demonstrates how to predict students' academic success using different machine-learning algorithms.\n",

    "The dataset contains data from students from the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre. It explicitly only includes information known at the time of students' enrollment and comprises features related to their academic path as well as to demographical and social-economic information. There are both numerical and categorical features included in the dataset.\n",

    "The project comprises 6 tasks, listed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To analyze and explore the dataset. To perform data pre-processing and cleansing.\n",
    "2. To calculate and visualize the correlation of features among each other and with the labels. To discuss an interesting correlation\n",
    "3. To train (at least) four machine-learning algorithms: One probabilistic, one tree-based, one distance-based and one ensemble method each.\n",
    "4. To evaluate the models using k-fold cross-validation. To report accuracy, mean standard deviation and a confusion matrix per model. To discuss whether one model is significantly better than the others\n",
    "5. To pick two favorite models. To discuss which features were most relevant for the students' success. To discuss differences between the two models\n",
    "6. So export the best performing model as ONNX to compete against other models"

    "A good example for the logic behind correlations can be seem by the ``age at enrollment`` which is highly correlated with three other features, namely the ``application mode``, ``marital status`` and ``daytime/evening attendance``. Knowing that a lot of people marry between the age of 25 and 30, the positive correlation between the age and marital mode makes sense as it states that younger students are less likely to be married. Furthermore, younger students are more likely to be full-time students, while older students are more likely to study part-time next to their job and possibly family. Thus it makes sense that younger full-time students applied through the general contigent and mostly study during daytime.\n",
